# Bank-Subscription-Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting whether a person will subscribe to a bank or not. The project utilizes Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM algorithms, with Random Forest being identified as the best performer even with class imbalances. The model is deployed using Streamlit for interactive web-based predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains a variety of features related to customer demographics, banking history, and other relevant attributes. It includes both numerical and categorical variables. 

## Model Evaluation
The Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. The evaluation results indicate that Random Forest performs the best, even in the presence of class imbalances.

## Deployment
The trained Random Forest model is deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive web interface for users to input data and receive predictions on whether a person will subscribe to the bank or not.
